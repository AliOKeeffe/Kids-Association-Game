# The Animal Association Game

The Animal Association Game is a fun educational game aimed at children between the ages of 4 and 7. The aim of the game is to match the animals to their preferred habitat and avoid selecting the wrong animals.

There are four habitats to choose from; farm, jungle, safari and sea. For each habitat there are two levels; easy and hard. The game is designed to be fun and engaging with the use of bright colourful imagery.

This game is a great way to teach kids about the different habitats that animals live in whilst also improving memory and picture recognition.
